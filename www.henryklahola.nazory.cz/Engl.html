Do not fear that sickness, nor any other sickness or anguish. Am I not here, who is your Mother? Are you not under my protection? Am I not your health? Are you not happily within my fold? What else do you wish? Do not grieve nor be disturbed by anything... (...Do not be afflicted by the illness of your uncle, who will not die now of it. Be assured that he is now cured.)" (Words of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Americas, to Seer Juan Diego on 12.Dec.1531) (Mat.6.25-26). Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they? O most Holy Trinity, I adore You! My God, my God, I love You in the most Blessed Sacrament! (Fatima, Mary, 13.Mai.1917) In the fall of 1916, the peace angel in Fatima held a golden chalice in one hand and a Host above it in the other. Drops of blood fell from the Host into the chalice. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving both suspended in mid-air he prostrated himself on the ground, saying this prayer: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Most Holy Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - I adore Thee profoundly. I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences whereby He is offended. And through the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After he gave the sacred communion to Lucia, Jacinta and Francisco, he prostrated himself on the ground and said with the children this prayer three times. <BR>
Josue 6:2. And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men. 6:3. Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day: so shallye do for six days. 6:4. And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets. 6:5. And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand. <I>Encircle the good with prayer to protect it from evil (Maria Esperanza, one of her last acts was to visit New York and prayed as it circled the Mother Cabrini Shrine, St. Ignatius Loyola church, and St. Patrick's Cathedral in mid-town Manhattan).</I> </P>

I  believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father before all worlds, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered, died and was buried. On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom shall have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. </P>

</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jesus Christ said through JUDr.PhDr.Mgr. et Mgr.Henryk Lahola: ”My people, I am showing you this printing operation in order to put your reading time in perspective. You have only a certain amount of time each day that you set aside to read a newspaper or magazine articles. I have also asked you especially during Lent to do more spiritual reading. Try and estimate how much time you spend reading each day, even if it is just an average. Then spend half of that time reading the Bible or spiritual books. Just as you are conscious of your nutrition and exercise time, so your spiritual life should be nourished and not forgotten. Again average the amount of time that you spend on your hobbies or TV watching and you should spend half of that time in daily prayer time. <BR>
If you are conscious of how you spend and allot your time each day, these suggestions could help you to make Me more a part of your life. Watching TV and secular reading will not help you get to heaven, but prayer and spiritual reading will support and strengthen your faith on your path to heaven.” </P>

He has shown the strength of his arm, he has scattered the proud in their conceit. He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.

While some of St. Bernard's writings do indeed echo the words of the Memorare, modern scholarship indicates that he did not in fact compose it. The piece rather appears to be a 16th century version of a 15th century prayer.  It was Claude Bernard (1588-1641) who first popularized the idea that St. Bernard composed it. A partial indulgence is granted to the faithful who recite the Memorare.</P>
